    {{#if isElvis}}
      <h3 class="text-center">Elvis Has Not Left the Building</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">What they want you to believe:</span> Elvis died on August 16, 1977. The coroner claimed he passed away from cardiac arrhythmia, possibly caused by an overdose of prescription pills.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The truth:</span> Elvis has been spotted by numerous witnesses since his alleged death. Several of his friends are still in contact with him. And if he hadn't known he was going to die, he would have ordered some sparkly gold suits for his concert tour--but he didn't.

    {{#if isBigfoot}}
      <h3 class="text-center">Bigfoot Walks Among Us</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">What they want you to believe:</span> Some people just have
        big feet and like to wander around the woods in ape costumes. Itâ€™s perfectly
        normal!
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The truth:</span> Between centuries of sightings, video
        footage, footprints left in the mud, and the possibility that Bigfoot can
        slip in and out of the space/time continuum, how can he not be real?
      </p>

    {{#if isUFO}}
      <h3 class="text-center">UFOs are Not Just Weather Balloons</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">What they want you to believe:</span> We are alone in
        this universe. Very, very alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The truth:</span> Aliens have been flying their
        spaceships around our planet since the beginning of time. Maybe your
        neighbor is an alien, as part of some student exchange problem?
      </p>

    {{#if isGhost}}
      <h3 class="text-center">Ghosts...Did You Hear That?</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">What they want you to believe:</span> That wisp of
        something you saw, or that voice you heard calling out in the night can easily
        be explained by your imagination, or the howling wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The truth:</span> Some people are restless, some have
        post-mortem agendas, and some are just in denial that they ever died at
        all. Feel that drop in temperature? See that light flicker? They're heeeerrreee!

    {{#if isTupac}}
      <h3 class="text-center">Tupac: Still Livin' the Thug Life</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">What they want you to believe:</span> Tupac Shakur was shot
        on September 7, 1996, and passed away in Las Vegas a week later from internal
        bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The truth:</span> Alive and well in Cuba, and probably still
        making albums and recording footage that is later compiled into holograms to
        be played at music festivals.
